info about folders/files located in this directory

Data_Out: Folder holding data in a form that is edited or different enough from
	its original from that I did not want to keep it in the DataWorking 
	directory. Data here is also in an intermediate from - not a final output.

HPC_Files: Main folder with contents matching working directories on HPC used in
	this project (e.g., Summit).

Python: Folder holding yaml files used for building environments and a 'Scripts' folder
	holding the python scripts written for the GAGESii work.

R: Folder holding info about R renv environment and a 'scripts' folder holding R scripts
	written for GAGESii work.

DataNotes.xlsx: Excel file with summary info for many of the datasets used in the GAGESii
	work. This file was used for identifying which features/variables to use and 
	to perform preliminary exploration of the datasets.

HPC_Files_Dissertation: Folder holding snapshot of HPC_Files at the time that my
	dissertation was completed. Those files were/will be further edited as we
	make edits/changes before submitting for peer review.
